## General info
LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. I will be using an entire year's worth of data (2019) to predict the credit risk of loans from the first quarter of the next year (2020).

## Predictions
Before running the unscaled data on the logisticRegression and Random Forest Classifier models, I believe that Logistic Regression will not be a good model for these data sets because of the differing variables.

## Technologies
* GitBash
* Jupyter Notebook
* pd.get_dummies()
* LogisticRegression
* RandomForestClassifier

## Results
Based on the training and testing score comparison, the LogisticRegression model makes better predictions after the data has been scaled, featured selected and then scaled again.
